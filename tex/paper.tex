\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

Notes for automating R and Latex

On Windows, install Miktex and ghostscript.
(Might need r devtools because you need 'make')

If you have PDFs you need to crop, add this to your PATH (may be in a dif folder, need Ghostscript):
  C:\textbackslash{}Program Files (x86)\textbackslash{}gs\textbackslash{}gs9.04\textbackslash{}bin

Makefile
Edit the first three lines

TEXFILE= paper \# this is the name of your main .tex file, without the extension

RDIR= . \# R working directory. A period indicates the tex files are in the same folder as the R files

FIGDIR= ./figures \#where the graphs(PDFs) are found by tex (you must be consisten in your R files)



\section{In Latex}\label{InLatex}

Use \\input\{petDancing\} to include an external text file.


\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
		\includegraphics{../figures/scatter.pdf}
	\caption{Sample Scatter Plot}
	\label{fig:scatter}
\end{figure}

Figure ~\ref{fig:scatter} shows a scatterplot for animal weight and height. The table ~\ref{tab:petColor} shows the counts for pets and color. The p value is \input{p}\unskip.

\input{petColor}

\section{References}\label{references}

%% BIBLIOGRAPHY AND OTHER LISTS

%% The Bibliography
%% ==> You need a file 'literature.bib' for this.
%% ==> You need to run BibTeX for this (Project | Properties... | Uses BibTeX)
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography} %'Bibliography' into toc
%\nocite{*} %Even non-cited BibTeX-Entries will be shown.
%\bibliographystyle{alpha} %Style of Bibliography: plain / apalike / amsalpha / ...
%\bibliography{literature} %You need a file 'literature.bib' for this.

This is a poorly formatted hack of a references section.
