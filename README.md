Goal of reproresearch
================================
The goal of this project is to provide a sample RStudio project that integrates R with Latex using make.

Why use make instead of Sweave?
-------------------------------
I prefer to keep R and Latex as separate as possible. It seems like if you use Sweave, you have one of two options:

* Do your analysis in .R files, then copy and paste into Sweave. You now have to maintain the code in two places.
* Endure the overhead of doing your analysis directly in Sweave the first time.

Neither workflow appeals to me. Your mileage may vary.

Make is a standard tool that works well. The Makefile for this project has been created so that only a few lines at most would need to be updated for a new project.

Requirements
------------
I have only tested this on Windows. However, all of the tools should be available for Linux and OSX. You will need:

* R
* RStudio
* Miktex
* Ghostscript
* make (comes with the devtools package or many other sources)

The versions shouldn't be terribly important.

Ensure that the Miktex and Ghostscript bin folders and make.exe are in your PATH in Windows.

Project Conventions
-------------------
The main folder stores the .R files. There are 3 subfolders:

* data. All data for the analysis goes here.
* figures. PDFs of plots go here.
* tex. The main paper.tex file is here, along with other .tex files generated by the .R scripts.

The following .R files are recommended:

* load.R. Loads the data. Should be very short.
* clean.R. Performs any transformations needed on the data, such as factoring strings.
* functions.R. Functions used throughout the analysis should be stored here.

In addition, as many other .R files can be added to perform the analysis.
